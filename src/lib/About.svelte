        <div class="distinction" class:selected={distinction == "Browser-based"}>
            Browser-based games offer key advantages like easy access-no downloads or installs required
            and the ability to play on almost any device with internet access. They're often free,
            cross-platform, and don't demand high-end hardware. With built-in social features and quick,
            casual gameplay, they're perfect for players looking for a simple, accessible gaming experience
            without the complexity of desktop or mobile games.

        <div class="distinction" class:selected={distinction == "Free to Play"}>
            Free-to-play games allow you to try them without any upfront cost, making them accessible to
            a wider range of players.
        </div>
        <div class="distinction" class:selected={distinction == "Multiplayer"}>
            Authentic multiplayer games are crucial because they create real, engaging interactions with
            other players, making the experience more dynamic and unpredictable. Playing against actual
            people, rather than just bots, brings a sense of challenge, competition, and cooperation that
            enhances the fun. Authentic multiplayer also fosters a genuine sense of community, where you
            can connect, communicate, and share experiences with others in real time, making the game more
            enjoyable and rewarding.
        </div>
        <div class="distinction" class:selected={distinction == "Live Chat"}>
            Live chat is key in authentic multiplayer games as it proves you're playing with real people,
            not bots. It also enhances the experience by allowing real-time communication, making the game
            more social, immersive, and connected.
